This is a webapp I created as a way for me to keep track of the piano songs I want to learn and get some practice using youtubes playlist API.
The webapp pulls data from my premade youtube playlist and displays each video along side its title and a google link to find some sheet music for each piece.

The goal was to get some practice using youtubes api and navigating through the datalist and make it easy for me to navigate through it. I may add some collapsible panels and a checkbox for me to make it more readable next.
