This is a webapp I created as a way for me to keep track of the piano songs I want to learn and get some practice using youtubes playlist API.
The webapp pulls data from my premade youtube playlist and displays each video along side its title and a google link to find some sheet music for each piece.

The goal was to get some practice using youtubes api and navigating through the datalist and make it easy for me to navigate through it. 

Things I'll add at a later time:
1. collapsible panels to make the list much easier to navigate
2. done button to mark off those that are completed 
3. split playlist into chunks so its not rendering a ton of videos at the same time.
4. maybe I'll make it look pretty later but not the point of this exercise.
